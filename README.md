## Problems during the development
- Path Issues: I struggled with linking the CSS, PDF, and image files correctly due to incorrect file paths. To fix this, I carefully reviewed my folder structure and ensured the paths in my HTML matched the project directory. example: images/ferrar1 insted of ../images/ferrari1

- Broken Links: Initially, some of the links to the PDF and my social media accounts didn’t work due to typos or incorrect URLs. Testing the links helped me ensure they directed to the right destinations.

- Styling Not Applying: At times, CSS changes didn’t reflect on the page. This was caused by either a cached version of the file or an incorrect CSS link in the HTML. I fixed this by clearing the browser cache and double-checking the link tag.

- Image Collage Display: Arranging the images in a proper collage was difficult because they kept stacking vertically. I solved this by applying CSS grid to the parent container and adjusting the size of each image.

- Footer Overlap: The footer occasionally overlapped with other content when the page didn’t have enough text. To fix this, I adjusted the footer’s position and added padding to create proper spacing.

- Grid/Flexbox Misconfiguration: I struggled with aligning elements properly within the grid and flexbox layouts. After reviewing my CSS styles, I fixed issues by properly defining grid columns and aligning items consistently.

## Conclusions
- The project successfully met the objectives, resulting in an ok web application. Through this experience I learned how to create resporsive desing principles and gain some experience with adavnce css feautures like variables, transitions and animations thanks to watching several tutorials to help understand better my work and be able to add more feautures to it. I was also able to catch easier some problemes i was having like the path issues at first it was really stressfull because the styles and images where not being applied to any page but was i understood the problem it was much easier to be able to fix it.
