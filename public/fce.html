                <h1>Course Overview</h1>
                <p>The course <strong>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering</strong> provides a comprehensive overview of Computer Engineering as both an academic discipline and a profession. The first part focuses on theoretical knowledge across three key areas: the societal role and historical evolution of Computer Engineering, the representation and organization of information, and current paradigms in information processing, management, and transmission. The second part emphasizes practical skills, including teamwork, ethical commitment, and communication, through workshops, oral presentations, and a hands-on web development project using software repositories. This course is all about helping students build solid technical skills while also developing key professional abilities, shaping them into well-rounded engineers.</p>
