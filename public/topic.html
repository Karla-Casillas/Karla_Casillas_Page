                <h2>Iconic Drivers</h2>
                <p>Ferrari has always been a team for the best of the best, with legends like Michael Schumacher, Niki Lauda, and Sebastian Vettel leaving their mark on the sport. Schumacher helped bring Ferrari back to dominance in the early 2000s, winning five straight Drivers' Championships from 2000 to 2004 and securing six Constructors' titles along the way. Lauda, one of the all-time greats, led Ferrari to two World Championships in the '70s, while Vettel gave it his all with multiple podiums and a few race wins, keeping Ferrari competitive even though he didn't grab a title. Fast forward to today, and Ferrari's got rising stars like Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. Leclerc has already bagged five Grand Prix wins and even took pole position at the 2022 Monaco GP, while Sainz has impressed with his consistency, snagging podiums and proving he's got what it takes. And in 2025, Ferrari will get a major boost with none other than seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton joining the team. With all his experience and skill, he's sure to add even more firepower to Ferrari’s already talented lineup. With a mix of legends, proven winners, and up-and-coming stars, Ferrari’s looking strong as ever, ready to chase more victories and titles in the seasons ahead.</p>

                <h2>Modern Era</h2>
                <p>In recent years, Ferrari has continued to push the boundaries of innovation with significant advancements in aerodynamics and hybrid power units, solidifying its position as a top contender in Formula 1. The team has focused on optimizing the airflow around their cars, with cutting-edge designs aimed at improving downforce, reducing drag, and enhancing overall car balance for better handling at high speeds. Ferrari’s hybrid power units, combining a turbocharged V6 engine with an energy recovery system (ERS), are among the most efficient in the sport, delivering impressive performance both on straightaways and in corners. These power units harness electrical energy from braking and heat recovery, allowing for improved acceleration and fuel efficiency. On top of this, Ferrari has made strides in refining their battery management systems and energy deployment strategies to gain a competitive edge. While the competition is intense, Ferrari’s relentless focus on technological advancements and car development ensures they remain a powerful force, continuously improving with every season. As the 2025 season approaches, they are set to push even further in their quest for more race wins and championships.</p>

                <h2>Why Ferrari Stands Out</h2>
                <p>The combination of passion, innovation, and a rich history makes Ferrari more than just a team; it’s an emblem of perseverance and triumph in the racing world. Ferrari has built its legacy not only on raw speed but also on a deep commitment to excellence in every aspect of racing. From their cutting-edge technology and advanced aerodynamics to their relentless drive to innovate, Ferrari constantly pushes the limits of what’s possible in Formula 1.

The team’s rich history is filled with unforgettable victories, legendary drivers, and groundbreaking achievements, making Ferrari synonymous with success in the world of motorsport.

                    One of the most iconic moments in Ferrari’s history comes from their success at the Monza Grand Prix, known as the "Temple of Speed." Monza is not only Ferrari’s home race but also one of the most prestigious and thrilling circuits in the world. It has been the site of countless memorable victories, with Ferrari securing a remarkable number of wins over the years. The connection between Ferrari and Monza goes beyond just race results it’s a celebration of their history and legacy, with the passionate Italian fans, known as the "Tifosi," filling the stands to support their beloved team. Ferrari’s dominance at Monza, including their unforgettable victories in the 2000s with Schumacher and their continuous pursuit of excellence, embodies the team's spirit and drive. 
                    
                    Whether it’s their record-breaking performances, iconic cars, or the fire that drives them to never settle for less, Ferrari stands out as a symbol of resilience and determination, constantly striving for greatness. This unique blend of passion, history, and innovation ensures that Ferrari will always remain at the heart of Formula 1, continuing to inspire and shape the future of the sport..</p>
