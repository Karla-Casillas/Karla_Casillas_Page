            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi! My Name is Karla Patricia Casillas Peñaloza. I am 18 years old. I was born on the 23 of may of 2006, in Mexico City. I have one little sister and two older Step-brothers. I spent my whole primary years till middle school in Westhill Institute, where I learned and got a certificate in French in a level C1. For High school I changed schools to the Tecnologico de Monterrey, where I did the International Baccalaureate; where I took Business Management, where my love for business came, German where I certificate a A2 level, Physics, economics, spanish Literature, Mathematics AA and I got certificated in a C1 level in english. I love participating in extracurriculars, so I was on the board of several student groups including the head of the student society.   
            </p>

            <p>I always had the idea of leaving Mexico to study abroad at the university but I never imagined that I would come to Spain. Currently I'm staying at a student residence where I have met amazing people and I'm falling more and more in love with Madrid. I’m currently pursuing a dual degree in Computer Engineering and Business and Data Analytics, in the Francisco de Vitoria University.  I’m driven by my love for problem-solving, innovation, and making a difference through technology. I knew i wanted to study business, but I didn't want to only study administration I wanted to go a little bit more, and I found a passion while learning about data analysis and taking business decisions based on the analysis, And my dream is to have my own company where I help create efficient softwares based on the data analysis of businesses to help them become more efficient and have smooth transitions with technology, and i know that in order to lead I need to know how to do what i would ask my employees to do, and that is why I choose computer engineer, to learn how to do stuff that i have always found interesting and exciting to do, and being able to fix problems myself.</p>
